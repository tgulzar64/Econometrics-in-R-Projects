# 📈 Econometrics Projects (R & Quarto)

This repository contains a collection of **applied econometrics projects implemented in R and Quarto**, focusing on **causal inference, regression analysis, and policy-relevant economic questions**. These projects emphasize **theoretical motivation, empirical rigor, and interpretation of results**, rather than black-box modeling.

Each project includes:
- Econometric modeling using R  
- Clear justification of variable selection and hypotheses  
- Regression diagnostics and robustness checks  
- Interpretation of results in an economic and policy context  
- Quarto (`.qmd`) files and supporting documents where applicable

### 🌍 Life Expectancy & Socioeconomic Factors
**Focus:** Health economics and public policy  
This project analyzes life expectancy using socioeconomic and demographic variables. Regression results are interpreted in the context of public health and policy, highlighting statistically significant and practically meaningful drivers of health outcomes.

---

### 💳 Loan & Credit Analysis
**Focus:** Lending behavior and financial risk  
An applied econometric analysis of loan data, studying factors that influence lending decisions, default risk, or credit outcomes. The project emphasizes causal reasoning and careful interpretation of statistically significant results.
