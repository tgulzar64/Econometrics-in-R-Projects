## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

\
\

```{r}
# Install necessary packages (run this only once if not already installed)
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("stargazer")

# Load libraries
library(readxl)
library(stargazer)

# Read the Excel file from your system path
Week11Airfare <- read_excel("C:/Users/USER/OneDrive - Institute of Business Administration/Desktop/Econometric/Week11Airfare.xlsx")

# Fit the full model (with year dummy variables)
lm_model_full <- lm(fare ~ dist + passen + bmktshr + y98 + y99 + y00, data = Week11Airfare)

# Fit the reduced model (without year dummies)
lm_model_reduced <- lm(fare ~ dist + passen + bmktshr, data = Week11Airfare)

# Display both models side by side
stargazer(lm_model_full, lm_model_reduced, type = "text",
          title = "Linear Regression Results: Full vs. Reduced Model",
          column.labels = c("Full Model", "Reduced Model"))
