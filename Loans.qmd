## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Load the dataset using the full path
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/USER/Downloads/Week0910CALoans (1).xlsx")

# Select relevant variables and drop NA rows for modeling
model_data <- data %>%
  select(Default, Recession, New, RealEstate, DisbursementGross, Portion) %>%
  na.omit()

# Convert Default to factor for logistic regression
model_data$Default <- as.factor(model_data$Default)

# Run logistic regression model
loan_model <- glm(Default ~ Recession + New + RealEstate + DisbursementGross + Portion,
                  data = model_data, family = binomial)

# Summarize the model
summary(loan_model)

# Optional: calculate predicted probabilities
model_data$predicted_prob <- predict(loan_model, type = "response")

# View head of data with predicted probabilities
head(model_data)

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed)
